# Autoencoder Applications

This project is divided into 2 parts .In the first part , I have implemented Convolutional Autoencoder and Denoising Autoencoder . This comparative study highlights the superior performance of Convolutional Autoencoder compared to the Denoising autoencoder because of the convolutional layers it has. The second part contains code for colorizing images and videos using OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained colorization model and applies it to images or frames of a video.
